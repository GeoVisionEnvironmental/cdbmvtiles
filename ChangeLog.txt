cdbtiles version history

Version 0.0.3

- Added support for retrying when CouchDB occasionally stops responding 
when under heavy load.  Also fixed some typos in documentation.

Version 0.0.2

- Fixed a bug using cdbtiles as a tile source when non-existent tiles were
requested, such as when no lat/lon ranges were specified to the tilelive 
copy command. Fix involved translating the CouchDB 404 error returned to
a custom 'Tile does not exist' error that tilelive expects and handles
gracefully.

Version 0.0.1

- Initial version.
